This is a simple program that uses an Arduino to control a stepper motor (through 
Adafruit's motor shield) to just rotate until a sensor identifies that it had
hit something. Also it support control through serial to start rotation again
or connecting to a membrane keypad.

Tested on:
* Arduino Mega ATmega1280
* Adafruit Motor shield - http://www.adafruit.com/mshield
* Parallax 4x4 membrane keypad - 27899
* Unknown small stepper motor

Details of required libraries can be found on the code.
